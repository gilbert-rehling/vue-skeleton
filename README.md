# Vue-Skeleton
This is a basic Vue Skeleton to get your project(s) started.

You might also be interested in my SASS-Skeleton once its completed - as it compliments this package.

This is currently a work-in-progress.
I'm using code from a previous project and making it as generic as possible.

You'll need to review the content that is being rendered and adjust the elements to suit you need.
Its primarily designed to display lists of data, provide switching between Gallery and List views, provide a Modal single item display, dynamic language changing, Image preview and slideshow.

There are elements that exist for potentially creating a members or admin areas too.
